# OsmInEdit

OsmInEdit is web tool to allow easy editing of OpenStreetMap indoor-related data.

You can use it at [osminedit.pavie.info](https://osminedit.pavie.info/) (or [here for under development version](https://osminedit.pavie.info/dev/)).

## Purpose

OsmInEdit aims to make [indoor data editing](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_Indoor_Tagging) easy on OpenStreetMap, ideally being as good as [iD editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD), but focused on building indoors. With this tool, you can contribute to make OpenStreetMap the best source of geo-data for both outdoors and indoors.

If you are looking for an indoor data viewer (a map for browsing existing data), have a look at [OpenLevelUp](https://openlevelup.net/).


## Contributing

This project is an open source tool, meaning it is made by volunteers. If you want to help us, there are several ways (technical or non-technical ones). You can find how to participate in the [contributing documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Develop/run your own instance

OsmInEdit is already available online, so you can use without any bothering (see link on top of this document). In case you want to run your instance of OsmInEdit, or work on its development, you can read [develop documentation](DEVELOP.md) to have all technical information.
